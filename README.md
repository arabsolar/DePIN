Step 1: Each of you becomes a partner of $olar. To do this, simply choose the tariff that suits you, where you select the suitable plan for you.

Step 2: After you have chosen a tariff and connected, you are guaranteed to participate in the Solar Loyalty Program (valid for the first 10,000 partners) and receive an AIRDROP. The reward amount depends on the plan you have chosen. Here, a flexible reward distribution system is used for participants! The AIRDROP will be automatically credited to you in the form of $olar project tokens.

Step 3: The most interesting process begins with the construction of solar stations and their integration into the overall system. There are already partnership agreements in which operational solar stations participate, enabling the project to launch quite rapidly. As solar energy is generated, partners receive $olar coins for selling solar energy.

Step 4: The entire described journey is impossible without you! This is how the most powerful communities are created; you not only profit from $olar, but also actively participate in the development of a comprehensive and vast ecosystem, where you specifically choose the path for the project's further advancement!
